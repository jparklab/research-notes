Abstract
Transformer-based large language model (LLM) inference
serving is now the backbone of many cloud services. LLM
inference consists of a prefill phase and a decode phase. How-
ever, existing LLM deployment practices often overlook the
distinct characteristics of these phases, leading to significant
interference. To mitigate interference, our insight is to care-
fully schedule and group inference requests based on their
characteristics. We realize this idea in TetriInfer through three
pillars. First, it partitions prompts into fixed-size chunks so
that the accelerator always runs close to its computation-
saturated limit. Second, it disaggregates prefill and decode in-
stances so each can run independently. Finally, it uses a smart
two-level scheduling algorithm augmented with predicted re-
source usage to avoid decode scheduling hotspots. Results
show that TetriInfer improves time-to-first-token (TTFT), job
completion time (JCT), and inference efficiency in turns of
performance per dollar by a large margin, e.g., it uses 38% less
resources all the while lowering average TTFT and average
JCT by 97% and 47%, respectively.

Introduction
Since the boom of ChatGPT, large language model (LLM)
based services have now played a vital role in our daily lives
[4,9,20,31,34,38]. Behind the scenes, all use cases boil down
to LLM inference serving. To run an inference request, the
LLM model will first take the user inputs to generate the first
token (known as the prefill phase), and then generate outputs
token-by-token in an auto-regressive manner (known as the
decode phase). Numerous works were proposed to improve
the cost efficiency of LLM inference [21,41].
There are various ways to interact with LLM, from sim-
ple chats to more complex downstream tasks such as docu-
ment summarization, content creation, etc. As a result, LLM-
empowered services serve inference requests with dramati-
cally different properties that can be categorized across two di-

mensions: the input prompt length during the prefill phase and
the generated token length during the decode phase. As shown
in Figure 1, summarization tasks have long input prompts and
short generated tokens, while context creation tasks are the op-
posite. Token lengths of different downstream tasks can differ
by more than two orders of magnitude. Given the significant
variation in LLM inference requests from various downstream
tasks, the first research question we ask in this paper is how
do these inference requests perform when running together?.
To answer this question, we run extensive tests that mix
LLM prefill and decode requests of different lengths. Un-
fortunately, we have observed serious interference across all
combinations. For example, mixing prefill requests could re-
sult in a 10x slowdown, combining prefill and decode requests
could lead to a 5x slowdown, and mixing decode requests with
different lengths could take a 16% throughput hit (see §2.2). A
naive solution to avoid interference is to provision resources
for each downstream task statically. Given the high cost of
LLM serving infrastructure, this solution is impractical. To
this end, the second research question we ask in this paper is
how to build a distributed LLM inference serving system that
minimizes interferences?
We take a step back to examine why interference exists.
We find the fundamental issue lies in the fact that current
LLM deployment practices do not account for the distinct
characteristics exhibited by LLM prefill and decode phases.
Specifically, the prefill phase resembles a computation-heavy
batch job, with its computation scaling quadratically with the
input prompt length. The decode phase resembles a memory-
intensive, latency-critical task, with its resource usage scaling
sublinearly with the generated token length [33]. Interferences
observed in our tests are classic system problems. Running
prefill requests leads to a serious slowdown because we con-
tinue adding computation-heavy jobs to an already saturated
hardware (§2.2.1). Combining prefill and decode requests
hurts both because we co-run batch and latency-critical jobs
simultaneously (§2.2.2). Mixing decode requests leads to
a throughput drop because we are unaware of the memory
bandwidth and capacity usage, thus leading to contention and

head-of-line blocking (§2.2.3).
To solve these issues, our insight is to carefully schedule
and group requests based on their characteristics. We realize
this idea in TetriInfer1, a cloud-scale LLM inference serving
system designed to battle interferences.
Our designs are three-fold. First, to avoid interference run-
ning prefill, we propose limiting the number of tokens pro-
cessed in a single prefill iteration so that hardware is fully
utilized without incurring extra penalties. TetriInfer partitions
and pads input prompts into fixed-size chunks so that the ac-
celerator always runs close to its computation-saturated limit
(§3.3). Second, to avoid interference in co-running prefill and
decode, we propose disaggregating prefill from decode phases.
TetriInfer has dedicated prefill and decode instances. During
runtime, prefill instances transfer prefilled KV cache to de-
code instances. The prefill and decode instances are virtual
concepts in that each can scale independently and flip roles
if load changes (§3.5). Third, to avoid interference running
decode requests, we propose using a smart two-level schedul-
ing algorithm augmented with predicted resource usage to
avoid scheduling hotspots (§3.4). TetriInfer incorporates an
LLM-based length prediction model to speculate the number
of generated tokens of decode requests, and then schedule
them accordingly.
We implement TetriInfer’s disaggregated prefill and decode
instances based on vLLM [21]. Most of our modules are im-
plemented in Python, except for the network stack module,
which utilizes C++ to interface with low-level APIs for KV
cache transfer. The fine-tuning part uses Trainer APIs offered
by HuggingFace Transformer [16]. Since we cannot access
high-end hardware, we implement a mock mechanism to emu-
late varying network bandwidth connecting prefill and decode
instances, as illustrated in Figure 9.
We compare TetriInfer with vanilla vLLM using public
dataset [35] in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT), job com-
pletion time (JCT), and efficiency as in performance per dollar
(perf/$). We run them atop a real testbed with emulated net-
work bandwidth ranging from 200Gbps to 300GBps. For light
prefill and heavy decode workload, TetriInfer improves perf/$
by 2.4x (Figure 12). For common mixed workload, TetriIn-
fer improves average TTFT and average JCT by 85% and
50%, respectively (Figure 15). Nevertheless, we also find that
TetriInfer’s design is not ideal for heavy prefill and heavy de-
code workloads since the room for improvement is marginal,
and the overhead we introduce cannot be offset (Figure 14).
Overall, our ideas mentioned above are effective. TetriIn-
fer achieves effective LLM inference serving, outperforming
vLLM by a large margin in TTFT, JCT, and perf/$ running
most common workloads (§5.1).
1The name of our system, TetriInfer, implies that it can efficiently organize
LLM inference requests, similar to how tetris blocks are stacked.

Background and Motivation
We present a brief primer on LLM inference and study inter-
ferences while running various LLM inference requests to
motivate our work. For model and testbed details, see §5.
2.1
Generative LLM Inference
LLM inference is a process that involves generating a se-
quence of output tokens in response to an input prompt. This
process consists of two phases: prefill and decode. The prefill
phase outputs the first token and generates the key and value
cache (KV cache) for future decoding [21]. The decode phase
uses the previous KV cache to generate new tokens step-
by-step in an auto-regressive manner. Generally, the prefill
phase is computation-bound, and the decode phase is memory-
bound [33]. We report this in Figure 2. Results indicate that
the prefill phase’s throughput stays flat once the accelerator is
saturated at a certain number of tokens (which we name the
accelerator-saturate threshold). The decode phase’s through-
put continues increasing with a larger batch size but plateaus
once the memory bandwidth is saturated.

requests concurrently. Inspired by Figure 1, we classify in-

ference requests across two dimensions (prefill and decode
length) and one property (light or heavy), resulting in four dis-
tinct request types: heavy prefill, light prefill, heavy decode,
and light decode. Here, heavy refers to a long token length,
while light refers to a short token length. Below, we study
mixing prefill and prefill (§2.2.1), prefill and decode (§2.2.2),
decode and decode (§2.2.3).
2.2.1
Prefill and Prefill
We first study mixing prefill requests. Here, light prefill has
roughly 18 prompt tokens as it is the median token length in
ShareGPT’s short prompts [35], while heavy prefill has 512
prompt tokens as the accelerator is saturated at this length in
our testbed (see Figure 2). In Figure 3 (a) and (b), we show
how a light prefill’s latency changes if it co-runs with other
light prefill and heavy prefill requests. We find its latency
increases by 2x and 8x if there are 7 and 63 concurrent light
prefill requests in the same batch. Additionally, it incurs more
than 10x latency slowdown if it runs with other heavy prefill
requests. In Figure 3 (c), we show that heavy prefill’s latency
also incurs a 3x slowdown if co-run with other light prefill
requests. Overall, we find that when the total number of tokens
in a batch is larger than the accelerator-saturate threshold, the
prefill latency dramatically increases.
2.2.2
Prefill and Decode
We now study mixing prefill and decode in the same batch
due to continuous batching [21, 45]. Both light prefill and
heavy prefill follow §2.2.1’s definition. Also, light decode
refers to the ones that generate a small number of tokens, e.g.,
less than 100. heavy decode refers to the ones that generate a
large number of tokens, e.g., larger than 512 tokens. Though
decoding latency increases slowly with an increasing number
of generated tokens, we only present tests related to light
decode as heavy decode presents similar results.
In Figure 4 (a) and (b), we show how a light decode’s per-
iteration decoding latency changes if it co-runs with light
prefill and heavy prefill requests. Results indicate that its

decoding latency increases by 5x even if only one other heavy
prefill request is in the same continuous batch! In Figure 4
(c) and (d), we show how a light prefill’s and a heavy prefill’s
latency changes if they co-run with other light decode requests.
Figure 4 (c) indicates that the prefill latency increases once
the number of co-running light decode requests is more than
7. Both slow down roughly by up to 2.5x.
2.2.3
Decode and Decode
We now study mixing decode requests. Following §2.2.2’s
definition and ShareGPT’s distribution, we set both requests
to use very short prompts. And light decode generates roughly
20 to 100 tokens, while heavy decode generates more than
512 tokens. Figure 5 presents the decoding throughput and
latency while running different numbers of light decode and
heavy decode requests in the same batch. Results suggest that
compared to a batch with all light decode requests, increasing
heavy decode requests could seriously hurt throughput and
latency. For example, with a batch size of 128, compared to a
batch with all light decode, a batch with half heavy decode
and half light decode’s throughput drops by 16% while the

latency increases by 23%.
2.3
Analysis and Insights
We have observed significant interferences in LLM inferenc-
ing. The root cause is simple: current LLM systems are igno-
rant of the distinct characteristics exhibited by LLM prefill
and decode phases. The prefill phase resembles a computation-
heavy batch job, while the decode phase resembles a memory-
intensive, latency-critical task [33].
Interferences measured above are classic system problems.
In §2.2.1, running prefill requests leads to a serious slow-
down because we continue adding computation-heavy jobs
to an already saturated hardware. In §2.2.2, mixing prefill
and decode requests hurts both because we co-run batch and
latency-critical jobs at the same time. In §2.2.3, mixing de-
code requests leads to a throughput drop because we are
unaware of the memory bandwidth and capacity usage, thus
leading to contention and head-of-line blocking.
Our work aims to solve these issues by carefully schedule
and group requests based on their characteristics. Our ideas
are three-fold. First, to avoid interference running prefill, we
propose limiting the number of tokens processed in a single
prefill step so that hardware is fully utilized without incur-
ring extra penalties. Second, to avoid interference co-running
prefill and decode, we propose disaggregating prefill from
decode so that each runs independently. Third, to avoid inter-
ference running decode requests, we propose to use a smart
two-level scheduling algorithm augmented with predicted re-
source usage to avoid scheduling hotspots. We visualize the
comparison in Figure 6 (a).

Design
3.1
Overview
We realize the above insights in TetriInfer, an LLM inference
serving system designed to battle interferences. First, we run
prefill in a fixed-size computation unit by partition and pad
input prompts into fixed-size chunks such that the accelerator
always runs close to its computation-saturated limit (§3.3).
Second, we design instances dedicated to running the prefill
or decode phases. We schedule prefill requests to prefill in-
stances only, and the same goes for decode requests. Prefill
instances will transfer prefilled KV cache to decode instances.
Our prefill and decode instances are virtual concepts in that
each can scale independently and flip roles if load changes
(§3.5). Finally, we design a two-level scheduling algorithm
for both prefill and decode request scheduling. We incorpo-
rate a length-prediction model to speculate decode requests’
resource usage and then schedule them accordingly (§3.4).
We show TetriInfer’s architecture in Figure 6 (b) with
four modules highlighted: centralized control plane, prefill
instance, decode instance, and length prediction model.
Centralized control plane. It consists of a global scheduler
and a cluster monitor. The global scheduler sends requests to
prefill instances based on load and receives streaming outputs
from decode instances. The cluster monitor collects statistics
from prefill and decode instances and regularly broadcasts
load information to prefill instances. It adds, removes, and
flips prefill or decodes instances.
Prefill Instances. They only run the prefill phase of an
LLM inference request. Each prefill instance has a local
scheduler, a length predictor, the main LLM engine, and a
dispatcher. All requests undergo four steps. First, the local
prefill scheduler sorts requests based on pre-defined policies.
Second, the length predictor runs a prediction model to spec-
ulate the requests’ decode lengths, which are then used to
estimate resource usage during the decoding phase. Third, the
main LLM engine partitions all requests into fixed chunks.
Finally, for each request, the dispatcher runs an inter-decode
load-balancing algorithm to select a decode instance and then
forwards the generated KV cache to it.
Decode instances. They are virtually disaggregated from
prefill instances and only run the decode phase of an LLM
inference request. Each decode instance can receive requests
from any prefill instance. It runs a local scheduler with three
pre-defined policies for selecting decode requests to run in
the main LLM engine.
Length Prediction Model. The prediction model is a small
LLM model fine-tuned offline for predicting the generation
length of LLM inference requests. TetriInfer’s prefill dis-
patcher and decode instance’s local scheduler utilize the spec-
ulated information to schedule decode instances and avoid
hotspots measured in §2.2.3. The prediction model is small
and deployed at all prefill instances.
3.2
Control Plane
TetriInfer has a centralized control plane to manage inference
clusters at the cloud scale. It consists of a cluster monitor
that manages the lifecycle of prefill and decode instances
and a global scheduler that managesthe lifecycle of inference
requests. The centralized control plane is a distributed system
without a single point of failure or processing bottlenecks.
The cluster monitor is responsible for collecting and broad-
casting statistics and scaling instances. Both prefill and de-
code instances regularly send their load information to the
cluster monitor (e.g., every 100 ms). Since we run decentral-
ized decode request scheduling at prefill instances, the cluster
monitor will aggregate decode instances’ load information
and broadcast it to all prefill instances.
The global scheduler is responsible for forwarding infer-
ence requests from external services to prefill instances and
sending inference outputs from decode instances back to ex-
ternal services in a streaming fashion. The global scheduler
maintains a request status table, which stores requests’ arrival
time, current phase (e.g., prefill or decode), SLA requirement,

Figure 6: TetriInfer’s Workflow and Architecture. (a) compares existing systems and TetriInfer’s execution timeline. The
existing systems part has two nodes running mixed prefill and decode. TetriInfer has separated prefill and decode instances. This
allows for the load-balancing of long decoding tasks across different on-demand decode instances. Each timeline comprises four
rounds (R1 to R4), with the length of prefill and decode boxes representing their sequence length and the width of the decode
box indicating its resource usage. A wider decode box indicates the presence of lengthy generated tokens, resulting in larger
resource usage and decoding latency. (b) shows TetriInfer’s architecture with four core modules highlighted.
etc. When a request arrives, the global scheduler will choose
a prefill instance with the least load and then insert the request
into the table. Following our insight to disaggregate prefill
and decode instances, the global scheduler only decides which
prefill instance will handle the request. It is up to the prefill
instance’s dispatcher to decide which decode instances to use
with a speculated resource usage.
3.3
Prefill Instance
The prefill instance runs the prefill phase of an inference
request. To avoid interference among prefill requests, we use
a prefill scheduler and chunked prefill to sort and partition
all prompts into fixed-size chunks. To help avoid interference
during the decode phase, we run a length predictor and a
decentralized dispatcher to choose decode instances based on
speculated resource usage.
3.3.1
Prefill Scheduler
The prefill instance’s scheduler is crucial for improving the
prefill phase’s latency and throughput. The scheduler main-
tains a raw request queue that stores requests from the global
scheduler and a scheduled queue that stores sorted requests.
In this work, we have designed and implemented three sched-
uler policies: first-come-first-serve (FCFS), shortest-job-first
(SJF), and longest-job-first (LJF). We can use the latter two
policies because we can accurately estimate a request’s pre-
fill time based on the number of tokens in its prompt. We
only explore non-preemptive policies, though chunked pre-
fill (described soon) has opened the door to preemptive and
out-of-order prefill scheduling, such as shortest-remaining-
time-first, which we leave for future work.
The scheduled requests are sent to the length predictor
which executes scheduled requests as-is using fixed-size
batch (§3.3.2), and the main LLM which uses chunked prefill
(§3.3.3). In Figure 7, we illustrate the above three sched-
uler policies and how scheduled requests are partitioned and
merged into fixed-size chunks. Specifically, FCFS keeps the
original request arrival order. Prompt tokens are partitioned
and merged into chunks sequentially. This policy is the easiest
to implement and works best for inference requests with simi-
lar prompt lengths. However, FCFS can lead to head-of-line
blocking and high average job completion time (JCT) when
requests have long prompts. This is problematic since the
length differences among LLM inference requests are more
than three orders of magnitude (see Figure 1).
In response, we add the shortest-job-first (SJF), and longest-
job-first (LJF) to overcome these issues. These two policies
schedule prefill requests based on prompt token lengths in as-
cending or descending order. By design, they can achieve
lower JCT compared to FCFS. Nevertheless, they are no
panacea. They introduce starvation for either long or short re-

quests. To avoid starvation, we propose using a prefill schedul-
ing batch (i.e., PrefillSchedBatch) variable to control how
many inference requests can be scheduled at a time. For ex-
ample, assume the raw request queue has twenty requests
awaiting scheduling. If we set the batch size to ten, we will
schedule twice, each with ten requests sorted and put into the
scheduled queue. This simple mechanism prevents starvation
during the prefill phase.
Our scheduler is effective. Results in Figure 16 show that
SJF lowers average prefill waiting time by 7.8% compared
to FCFS when the batch size is set to 16. Additionaly, the
improvement is even more pronounced with larger batch sizes.
3.3.2
Length Predictor
To address the interference cases measured in §2.2.3, it is
essential to determine the number of tokens that a decode
request is likely to generate. This information will enable us
to schedule decode requests in a length-aware manner. As
such, the prefill instance runs a length predictor to predict
the length range of an inference request’s generated tokens.
The prefill instance’s dispatcher utilizes this information for
inter-decode instance scheduling (§3.3.4), while the decoding
instance’s local scheduler employs this information for intra-
decode instance scheduling (§3.4).
Our length predictor uses a small LLM-based classifica-
tion model called a "predict model" to classify the length of
generated tokens into fixed-size buckets if the request were
executed by a specific target LLM model. The predict model
is intentionally small, containing millions of parameters while
the target model is much larger, with billions of parameters.
As we run the length predictor at the prefill instance, we
aim to minimize its cost and avoid impacting the main LLM
model. Therefore, approaches like using a giant LLM to pre-
dict length are not feasible for us [48]. Fortunately, a small
LLM model is much faster than a giant LLM and uses much
less resources. For example, we use OPT-125M as the predict
model and OPT-13B as the target model, the small one is
roughly ten times faster than the larger one.
We opt to predict the length range instead of an exact num-
ber of tokens because the latter is extremely difficult to predict.
Various inference parameters, such as temperature and top-
p [3], result in significant response variations from the same
LLM model to the same question in practice. Since our pri-
mary goal is to use the estimated length to guide our request
scheduling decisions, an exact length estimation is unneces-
sary; a length range suffices. For instance, if we estimate the
length to be between ten to twenty tokens, we can deduce its
resource usage’s lower and upper bounds.
In this work, we have tested two execution modes: a sequen-
tial mode, where we first execute the predict model followed
by the target model, and a parallel mode, where both mod-
els are run simultaneously. The sequential mode adds extra
latency for the target LLM model, while the parallel mode
may reduce the target LLM model’s throughput. Based on
our findings in Figure 17, we opted to use the parallel mode
because the main LLM is not affected for most requests (more
than 80%), though throughput take a 10% hit under extreme
stress test.
Figure 8 outlines the offline fine-tuning and online predic-
tion workflow. In this process, the predict model (depicted in
red) is trained to speculate the decoding behavior of a specific
target model (depicted in blue). The fine-tuning of the predict
model involves three key steps. Firstly, we assemble a prompt-
only training dataset inherited from public datasets, a large
target LLM model (e.g., OPT-13B), and a classification model
for our predict model (e.g., 125M OPTForSequenceClassifi-
cation [16]). Secondly, we send training prompts to the target
LLM model, which generates responses. Subsequently, we
categorize the generated responses into fixed-size buckets
with a chosen granularity. For instance, using a granularity
of 100, responses with token lengths between 0 to 200 are
labeled with 0, 200-400 are labeled with 1, and so on. These
labels are paired with the training prompts to create a new
dataset. Lastly, we partition the new dataset into a training
section and an evaluation section and then proceed to train
and evaluate the predict model using this dataset.
The length range granularity plays a crucial role. If set to
one, we fall back to predicting an exact number of tokens,
which is not practical. If set to target model’s context window
size (e.g., 2K), we fall back to no prediction at all and could
run into interferences reported in §2.2.1. Intuitively, a smaller
granularity means more accurate resource and performance
estimation but lower accuracy in practice. A larger granular-
ity means higher accuracy but essentially makes scheduling
harder. Regardless of granularity, it’s easy to calculate re-
source usage’s upper and lower bound but not performance.
In this work, we can predict a granularity of 200 tokens with
74.9% accuracy. Since improving prediction accuracy is not
the focus of this work, we leave it for future work.
Discussions. We run the length predictor at each prefill
instance, hence prefill instances can make well-informed de-
cisions on which decode instances should have enough re-
sources to run certain decoding requests. Nevertheless, we
identify two alternative designs. The first design is to run
the length predictor at each decode instance. As a result, the

prefill instance can only schedule requests based on the load
of decoding instances. However, this design cannot avoid in-
terference cases we measured in §2.2.3. Indeed, one could
migrate interference requests among decoding instances at
runtime based on predicted length. This would be an overly
complex solution. The second design is to run the length
predictor at the global scheduler before dispatching requests
to refill instances. This design could make the global sched-
uler a bottleneck. We believe our current design is easier and
simpler to reason about and deploy compared to alternatives.
3.3.3
Chunked Prefill
After the prefill scheduler, we concurrently execute the prefill
phase of the main LLM alongside the length predictor. We
employ fixed-size chunks for the LLM prefill rather than using
fixed batch sizes [21].
As demonstrated in §2.2.1, we observe that as the num-
ber of tokens in a prefill iteration increases, the accelerator’s
throughput remains constant, while the latency continues to
rise after reaching a certain threshold. We refer to this thresh-
old as ChunkSize. Compared to the traditional fixed batch
size approach, running prefill in ChunkSize allows for the op-
timal utilization of accelerators without incurring additional
latency penalties. The accelerator and the LLM model archi-
tecture determine the ChunkSize. Models with larger hidden
dimensions and accelerators with lower capabilities typically
result in a smaller ChunkSize. For example, in our test envi-
ronment, the value is 512 tokens for OPT 13B.
Figure 7 illustrates how chunked prefill works for different
scheduler policies. For scheduled requests, we first slice and
then merge prompt tokens into fixed-size chunks without
altering their order. The final chunk in a batch could be partial,
and we will pad it to ChunkSize with zeros. Then, we invoke
the main LLM model to execute prefill forward one chunk at
a time. To record progress, we maintain a simple variable per
request that records the last prefilled token position.
The benefits of using chunked prefill and various prefill
scheduler policies are substantial. In Figure 16, we compare
vanilla vLLM, which uses fixed batch size for prefill, against
TetriInfer which uses chunked prefill along with FCFS, SJF,
and LJF. Chunked prefill with FCFS lowers average prefill
latency by 86.4%. Additionally, we avoid the interference
cases measured in §2.2.1 as heavy prefill requests are broken
into fixed-chunks and the accelerator is best utilized.
Discussion. (1) An early work, Sarathi [1], has also pro-
posed chunked prefill for the same purpose, where they utilize
prefill-decode-mixed chunks. In contrast, our approach in-
volves running prefill-only chunks as we disaggregate LLM’s
prefill and decode into separate instances. (2) Our length
predictor utilizes a small LLM model for prediction and con-
tinues using fixed-size batching instead of chunked prefill.
This is due to the model’s small size, which does not exhibit
a clear compute-saturate threshold as seen in larger models.
3.3.4
Dispatcher
The prefill instance’s final module is the dispatcher, which
carries out two essential steps for each prefilled request. First,
it runs an inter-decode instance scheduling algorithm to se-
lect a decode instance and then transmits the prefilled KV
cache to the chosen instance. The dispatcher runs on an event-
driven basis, running whenever there are prefilled requests
(or chunks). The disaptcher plays a vital role in mitigating
decode and decode interferences as measured in §2.2.3.
Once a request’s initial chunk is prefilled, the dispatcher
invokes a decentralized load-balancing algorithm to select
a decode instance with sufficient resources to run this re-
quest’s decode phase. Our algorithm consists of three steps.
First, we categorize decode instances into two sets: α, those
with enough resources to execute the chosen request, and β,
those without. Recall that the prefill instance has all decode
instances’ load information broadcasted from the cluster mon-
itor (§3.2). With the predicted length range (§3.3.2), finding
decode instances with adequate resources for executing this
request’s decode phase is easy. Second, we use the power-
of-two [25] algorithm to choose two instances from the α
set randomly. Lastly, from the two instances, we choose the
one that would encounter the least interference if the prefilled
request is sent to it. Based on Figure 5, our goal is to establish
the lowest average ratio of heavy decode:light decode, which
means we need to spread heavy decode requests evenly. Fig-
ure 19 proves our algorithm is effective, achieving the lowest
total decoding time compared to other policies.
Once a decision is made, the dispatcher sends this request’s
metadata and prefilled KV cache to the selected decode in-
stance. Crucially, there are two key design considerations
for transferring KV Cache: (1) transfer granularity and (2)
network stack for transferring the cache.
We begin by discussing granularity. Due to our use of
chunked prefill, the prefilled KV cache is created in chunks

provides bandwidth in the hundreds of GBs (e.g, NVLink

in the hundreds of Gbs (e.g, ConnectX-6 200Gbps). The 1-
sided stack means the sender accelerator can transmit data to
the receiver accelerator without involving the receiver’s CPU.
(§3.3.3). As a result, we have the option to transfer the KV
cache either at a chunk-level, sending each chunk’s KV cache
as it is generated, or at a request-level, sending the aggregated
KV cache for a request until all of its chunks are prefilled.
Utilizing chunk-level transfer enables us to parallelize chun-
ked prefill and KV cache transfer, while request-level transfer
allows us to minimize the number of network transfers by
sending larger data. A concurrent work [32] has proposed
layer-wise KV cache transfer, which aligns with our chunk-
level approach. Combining their layer-wise approach with
our chunk-level transfer could further optimize compute and
network parallelization. In this work, we only implement
request-level transfer for simplicity and leave the chunk-level
transfer to future work.
We now delve into the network stack. Once the main LLM
completes its prefill phase, the prefilled KV cache is generated
at the accelerator’s memory (e.g., GPU’s HBM). Our goal is
to transmit this cache to the selected decode instance’ acceler-
ator memory, regardless of the hardware platforms on which
our system is deployed. This is challenging as multiple physi-
cal data links exist between the prefill and decode instances,
each requiring different software stacks. We classify existing
physical data links into three types, as shown in Figure 9. The
first is called Direct, where accelerators have a directly con-
nected high-speed link such as NVLink [40] or HCCS [13].
We can use low-level memory copy primitives [14, 26] or
collective libraries [28] to transmit data over these links. The
second is called Direct-NIC, in which accelerators commu-
nicate via their companion NICs. We can use custom-built
libraries [27] to transmit data over PCIe and Ethernet (or
Infiniband). The third is called Indirect, where there is no
direct link, and the accelerators must bounce data via their
companion CPU DRAM, incurring extra memory copies. In
Figure 9, we also categorize network stacks that utilize afore-
mentioned data links into one-sided and two-sided, similar to
RDMA’s classification. Accelerators like GPU or NPU can do
one-sided memory access as they have low-level primitives
such as direct memory copies between devices [14,26].
To navigate the complicated physical data links and ensure
that TetriInfer can always use the most performant link once
deployed, we design a unified network transfer abstraction to
utilize the different network stack options listed in Figure 9.
The stack exposes APIs such as send, receive, read, write, etc.
Our dispatcher calls these APIs to transmit the KV cache to
remote decode instances.
Discussion. We identify two unexplored research questions.
The first question pertains to whether it is beneficial to simul-
taneously utilize multiple data links for transmitting the KV
cache. While this approach could enhance performance, it
may also introduce complex control logic. The second ques-
tion involves the sender accelerator accessing the memory
of the receiver accelerator without involving the receiver’s
CPU. This scenario raises typical challenges associated with
building large-scale RDMA-based memory systems [10,12].
Unfortunately, we cannot explore either of these ideas in this
work due to limited access to high-end hardware.
3.4
Decode Instance
The decode instance runs the decoding phase of an inference
request. As shown in Figure 6, it includes a receiver module,
which is part of the unified network transfer module, a local
scheduler, and an LLM for decoding. The processing steps
are straightforward. The receiver module accepts requests
transmitted from remote prefill instances and waits for pre-
filled KV caches to be received before adding them to the
local scheduler’s queue. The scheduler uses continuous batch-
ing to group dynamic-sized batches and invokes the LLM
for decoding in an auto-regressive fashion. We implement
TetriInfer based on vLLM [21] (see §4). Hence, it manages
the KV cache in pages rather than reserved for the maximum
context length [29,45].
With the predicted length information sent from the pre-
fill instance, we propose two working-set-aware scheduling
policies in addition to vLLM’s vanilla one. vLLM’s existing
policy schedule requests in a greedy fashion. As long as the
accelerator has spare memory, it will add requests to the cur-
rent iteration. However, it may run out of memory in future
iterations and cause thrashing. Fundamentally, it is oblivious
to the working set size.
To address this limitation, we propose reserve-static and
reserve-dynamic policies, both aim to prevent triggering
swaps. Under the reserve-static policy, a request is scheduled

only if its predicted memory usage is smaller than the avail-
able accelerator memory for the current iteration. In contrast,
the reserve-dynamic policy takes a more proactive approach
by considering the predicted number of remaining tokens.
Specifically, a new request is added to the scheduled batch
only if there is still spare memory when the shortest remaining
job in the batch finishes. This approach effectively mitigates
memory thrashing while maximizing the advantages of pag-
ing. Our tests in Figure 18 suggest that with our current pre-
diction accuracy, these two policies are on par with vLLM’s
greedy policy. When the prediction accuracy increases, these
two policies can lower the average JCT by roughly 10%.
3.5
Instance Flip
TetriInfer scales out by allocating more hardware resources.
Additionally, TetriInfer can also dynamically adjust the num-
ber of prefill and decode instances within fixed hardware
resources. This is crucial as LLM inference workloads have
huge variations regarding prefill and decode needs (see Fig-
ure 1), and we cannot statically provision the ratio of prefill
and decode instances in advance. Below, we will describe our
policy and mechanism to flip a prefill instance to become a
decode instance and vice versa.
Policy. As we described in §3.2, the centralized control
plane oversees all instances and has the latest load informa-
tion. We design a transition watcher module that regularly
checks load and decides whether certain instances should be
flipped. Various policies can be plugged in, such as flipping
an instance if its load has been under 10% for the past minute.
Mechainsm. Once an instance is selected, we will go
through the steps depicted in Figure 10. To flip a prefill in-
stance, the global scheduler stops forwarding requests and
then sends a flip request to it. The prefill instance will wait
until all queued requests are drained. Then, we flip the in-
stance. Flipping a decode instance is slightly more complex.
The global scheduler notifies all prefill instances to stop for-
warding requests to the selected decode instance and notifies
the decode instance to complete flipping. Note that the actual
flipping is fast and simple. It involves changing an internal
variable without restarting the process or reloading models. In
our current implementation, both instance flips take roughly
5 to 7 ms, excluding the dynamic draining time.
4
Implementation
We implement TetriInfer’s centralized control plane from
scratch in Python. We adopt prefill and decode instances
based on vLLM [21]. Most of our core modules are imple-
mented in Python, except for the unified network stack, which
utilizes C++ to interface with low-level APIs and IB Verbs
for network transfer. Additionally, we implement a shared-
memory-based communication mechanism that enables fast
command transfer across Python and C++ languages. The
fine-tuning part uses Trainer APIs offered by HuggingFace
Transformer [16].
A prefill or decode instance is a single deployable unit
consisting of two processes when deployed. For prefill, it has
a Python process that runs the scheduler, length predictor,
and the main LLM, as well as a C++ process that runs the
dispatcher and the network stack. For decode, it has a Python
process for running the scheduler and the main LLM, along
with a C++ process that runs the network stack.
Due to limited high-end hardware availability, our current
implementation only supports the Indirect type using sock-
ets (see Figure 9). In order to evaluate TetriInfer’s perfor-
mance across different hardware configurations, we have im-
plemented a mock mechanism to emulate varying network
bandwidth. This mechanism works as follows: for a given
set of requests, we initially run their prefill phase offline to
obtain their prefilled KV cache. Before testing, we load these
prefilled KV caches into the decode instance’s local mem-
ory. When testing starts, the prefill instance transmits only
the request metadata to the decode instance, excluding the
actual prefilled KV cache. Subsequently, the decode instance
calculates the latency of the KV cache transfer and waits ac-
cordingly. This latency is calculated given a specific model
architecture and the hardware bandwidth we aim to emulate.
5
Evaluation
We evaluate TetriInfer using public dataset [35] and report
time-to-first-token (TTFT), job completion time (JCT), and
efficiency as in performance per dollar (perf/$).
Our testbed consists of four NVIDIA V100 GPUs, each
with 32GB HBM. All GPUs are plugged into a single server
with Xeon Gold 5218R CPU and 256GB DRAM. For the
large LLM, we run OPT-13B [47]. For the length prediction
model, we use OPT-125M. We compare with vLLM [21].
Since we adopted TetriInfer after vLLM, both systems manage
KV caches in pages. Unlike TetriInfer, vanilla vLLM tightly
couples prefill and decode phases.
5.1
End-to-End Performance
This section compares TetriInfer with vanilla vLLM using
end-to-end benchmarks. We emulate TetriInfer atop two hard-
ware setups using the mock mechanism described in §4. The
9


---

first is TS-RoCE, assuming prefill and decode instances com-
municate over 200Gbps RoCE (Direct-NIC in Figure 9). The
second is called TS-NVLink, assuming instances communicate
over 300GBps NVLink (Direct in Figure 9). Both setups are
adopted from commercial V100-based servers.
For all tests, the prefill instance’s scheduler uses the
SJF policy as it has the best performance with the
PrefillSchedBatch set to 16 (see Figure 16). For the inter-
decode instance scheduling, we use the decentralized load-
balancing algorithm as it outperforms other policies. For the
intra-decode instance scheduling, we use the reserve-dynamic
policy atop paging as it could outperform vLLM’s greedy
policy (see Figure 18). We flip an instance once it becomes
idle for a minute using mechanisms described in §3.5.
To understand how these systems perform under mixed
downstream inference tasks, we run five different types of
workloads as presented in Figure 1: Heavy Prefill with Light
Decode (HPLD), Heavy Prefill with Heavy Decode (HPHD),
Light Prefill with Heavy Decode (LPHD), Light Prefill with
Light Decode (LPLD), and Mixed. Akin to the configura-
tion used in §2.2, prefill requests that have more than 512
prompt tokens are categorized as heavy, and others are light.
Decode requests with more than 128 tokens are categorized
as heavy as ShareGPT answers’ median length is 128. We
generate these workloads using samples from the ShareGPT
dataset [35], following the distribution illustrated in Figure 1.
For each workload, we compare all systems across three
key metrics: TTFT, JCT, and resource usage time (i.e., cost).
Comparing TTFT indicates whether TetriInfer’s prefill sched-
uler and chunked prefill are effective. Comparing JCT indi-
cates whether TetriInfer’s disaggregated prefill and decode
design and two-level decode scheduling are effective. A natu-
ral question that centers around our disaggregated design is
cost. Intuitively, TetriInfer uses two times the resources com-
pared to vLLM’s prefill-decode-coupled setting. Our results
suggest otherwise. Two factors contributed: first, TetriInfer’s
prefill and decode run faster; second, TetriInfer can recycle
or flip instances to reduce waste. Below, resource usage time
represents the aggregated wall time that the prefill and de-
code instances use to run a particular workload. For example,
the resource usage time is 3 seconds if we run prefill in in
1 second and decode in 2 seconds. For vLLM, it is the total
runtime since it couples prefill and decode.
We now present each workload’s results.
Light Prefill and Light Decode. Generally, LPLD repre-
sents the chat workload. We test LPLD in Figure 11 using 128
requests. When comparing TetriInfer to vLLM, we reduce
average TTFT by 44% and average JCT by 40% for both
emulated hardware setups. Despite using twice the number
of hardware cards, TetriInfer completes tasks almost twice as
fast, resulting in resource usage time that is comparable to the
vanilla vLLM. Thus, we improve perf/$ by 1.4x.
Light Prefill and Heavy Decode. Generally, LPHD rep-
resents the content creation workload. We test LPHD in Fig-
ure 12 using 128 requests. Surprisingly, TetriInfer improves
average TTFT by 97% despite using short prompts. This
is because vLLM’s prefill incurs serious interference while
running prefill and decode requests in the same batch; in con-
trast, TetriInfer disaggregates them into separate instances.
Additionally, with variable decode batch size over vLLM’s
fixed batch size during the decode phase, TetriInfer improves
average JCT by 47% while using 38% less total hardware
resources. Overall, we improve perf/$ by 2.4x.
Heavy Prefill and Light Decode & Heavy Prefill and
Heavy Decode. HPLD and HPHD represent summarization
or prompt engineering types of workloads. Both have long
prompt tokens. This means TetriInfer faces two challenges:
(a) large prefilled KV caches and (b) the main LLM may be
impacted by the prediction model (roughly 10% as shown
in Figure 17). Nevertheless, in Figure 13, we can see that
TetriInfer still improves average TTFT and average JCT by
9% and 23%, respectively, but at the cost of 43% increase
in resource usage. vLLM outperforms TetriInfer in terms
of perf/$ by 14%. As Figure 14 shows, with heavy decode,
TetriInfer’s TTFT improvement is more pronounced because
we disaggregated heavy decode from prefill, akin to Figure 12.
We improve the average JCT by 19% at the cost of 7% more
resources, improving perf/$ by 1.1x.
Mixed. The last workload is a mix of all the above work-
loads, randomly sampled from the ShareGPT dataset. This
is the case where a cluster is running all kinds of requests.
In Figure 15, we run 128 requests, TetriInfer lowers average
TTFT, average JCT, and resource usage by 85%, 50%, 21%,
respectively, improving perf/$ by 1.9x.
Takeaways. (1) For most LLM inference workloads, Tetri-
Infer improve average TTFT, average JCT, resource use time,
and most importantly, perf/$ by a large margin. (2) Disaggre-
gating prefill from decode into two distinct instances signif-
icantly improves TTFT and efficiency by minimizing inter-
ference, particularly for workloads with heavy decodes such
as LPHD and HPHD. (3) TetriInfer’s design is not ideal for
HPHD workloads as the room for improvement is small, and
the overhead we introduce cannot be offset.
5.2
Microbenchmark
5.2.1
Prefill Scheduler
Below, we study the overhead of sorting requests, compare
different policies, and study the impact of batch size on per-
formance. Note we run OPT-13B TP=2, ChunkSize is set to
512, and vLLM’s batch size is set to 16.
Sort. Our scheduler sorts incoming requests based on the
length of their input tokens if non-FCFS policies are used. We
use Python’s native sort API. We find the sorting overhead
ranges from 10s to 100s of microseconds, which is negligible
compared to millisecond-level or second-level TTFT latency.

pare TetriInfer which uses chunked prefill along with FCFS,
SJF, and LJF, against vanilla vLLM, which uses fixed batch
size for prefill. Requests used in this test follow the ShareGPT
distribution. In the left part, we set PrefillSchedBatch to
16. Compared to vLLM’s fixed batch mode, chunked prefill
alone with FCFS improves latency by 86.4%. Additionally,
the SJF scheduler policy further lowers the average waiting
time by 7.8%. The right part examines the impact of adjust-
ing PrefillSchedBatch. When we increase the batch size
from 16 to 128, SJF’s average TTFT decreases by 46.5%.
The improvement in TTFT increases with a larger scheduling
batch.
5.2.2
Length Predictor
Our length predictor uses the OPT-125M classification model
to speculate the decoding behavior of the OPT-13B model
(§3.3.2). This section studies the performance of both models
and the prediction accuracy.
In Figure 17, we run stress tests among several settings re-
garding per-iteration latency and throughput. L-Alone means
running the OPT-13B model alone, using chunked fill with
ChunkSize set to 512. P-Alone means running the OPT-125M
prediction model alone. It does not use chunked prefill but
uses dynamic batch sizes. It can group multiple requests into
a batch. Due to the limitation of [16], we need to pad requests
in a batch to the longest one. For example, if we have two
requests in a batch, one has 100 tokens, and the other has 500
tokens. Then, we need to pad the first to 500 tokens. This
is costly for requests with short prompts. Hence, we set a
cutting limit. Requests higher than the limit will run alone.
The default is 512 tokens. L+P512 means OPT-13B model’s
performance if co-runs with the small OPT-125M in parallel.
The suffix number means the max padded size. We can see
that the large LLM’s prefill latency is roughly ten times of the
small LLM’s. If we co-run both models and a padding limit of
512, 80% of large LLM’s prefill requests remain unchanged
compared to when it runs alone. Overall, while co-running
with a small LLM, the large LLM’s average prefill latency
increases by 10%, and throughput drops by 12%. Note that
these are stress tests. The impact will be smaller in practice.
We believe beefier hardware can further mitigate the drop.
We train our OPT-125M prediction model using 75K train-
ing data from ShareGPT. We test the model using three differ-
ent length range granularities: 100, 200, and 400. The accu-
racy achieved by our prediction model for these granularities
is 58.9%, 74.9%, and 85%, respectively.

5.2.3
Decode Scheduling
We now study the scheduling policies related to decode in-
stances. We first compare intra-decode instance scheduler
policies (§3.4) and then compare different load balance algo-
rithms for inter-decode instance scheduling (§3.3.4). All tests
use OPT-13B with TP=2.
We compare three intra-decode scheduler algorithms,
namely vLLM’s greedy, TetriInfer’s reserve-static (RS), and
reserve-dynamic (RD) in Figure 18. We run 256 requests fol-
lowing ShareGPT distribution. Our policies estimate resource
usage using the predicted length range’s lower end. We com-
pare using the actual accuracy (acc-200 74.9%) and an ideal
accuracy of 100%. While using the actual accuracy, reserve-
dynamic achieves the same JCT as vLLM’s greedy algorithm.
When using an ideal prediction accuracy, reserve-dynamic
and reserve-static improve average JCT by 12% and 10%,
respectively. This is because our policies carefully provision
requests based on their memory usage.
We compare three distributed load balance algorithms in
Figure 19. Firstly, we present our decentralized power-of-
two algorithm, designed to distribute requests based on pre-
dicted length. The second is random, in which the prefill
instance randomly chooses a decode instance. The third al-
gorithm, imbalance, simulates a worst-case scenario where
heavy decode requests are consistently directed to the same
decode instances. We run 32 requests per decode instance,
spanning the range of 2 to 8 decode instances. Figure 19’s
left part shows that TetriInfer’s decentralized load balancing

algorithm is effective, achieving the lowest total decoding
time. The right parts show the number of heavy decode and
light decode requests in the slowest instance. Cleary, Tetri-
Infer’s inter-decode scheduling algorithm evenly balances
load across instances, which avoids interferences measured
in §2.2.3.

Related Work
Table 1 compares TetriInfer with other closely related works.
We are among the first to disaggregate prefill and decode
in LLM inference, concurrent to Splitwise [32]. Sarathi [1]
has proposed chunked prefill to overcome suboptimal pre-
fill processing. They run prefill-decode-mixed chunks. In
contrast, TetriInfer runs prefill-only chunks as we observe
non-neglible interference between prefill and decode, thus
choose to disaggregate prefill from decode. FastServe [41]
utilizes a multi-level priority feedback queue to minimize JCT.
In contrast, TetriInfer utilizes two-level scheduling for prefill
and decode instances. Our policies are working-set-aware,
reducing interference and swaps thereby improving JCT and
efficiency. Many recent work focus on optimizing batching,
caching, and scheduling [2, 23, 30]. Specifically, Orca [45]
introduce the iterative-level scheduling. Sheng et.al [36] have
proposed a fair scheduler based on the continuous batching
mechanism. Many works try to optimize memory usage. For
example, using quantization [7,8,11,19,22,37,42,43] to com-
press the model weights into lower precision, using paging
to reduce fragmentation [21], and low-level algorithm and

kernel optimizations [5,6,15,24,39,44,46]. Those works are
orthogonal to our efforts to mitigate interference.

Conclusion
We propose TetriInfer, an LLM inference serving system de-
signed to battle interference. Our key insight is to carefully
schedule and group inference requests based on their char-
acteristics. It has three key parts. First, it partitions prompts
into fixed-size chunks, ensuring the accelerator consistently
operates at its computation-saturated limit. Second, it disag-
gregates prefill and decode instances to avoid interference
when mixing them together. Finally, it uses a smart two-level
scheduling algorithm to avoid decode scheduling hotspots.
Results show that TetriInfer improves time-to-first-token, job
completion time, and inference efficiency in terms of perfor-
mance per dollar by a large margin.
